The goal of ryx is to provide a package for conducting correlation analysis, summarizing the results, and visualizing the findings in a publication-ready format. The package is designed to simplify the process of calculating correlation coefficients between a dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (x), and to produce easy-to-read summaries and plots for quick interpretation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ryx like so:

```{r}
# Install the ryx package
install.packages("ryx")
```


```{r}
# Install the MASS package
install.packages("MASS")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
It uses the Boston dataset from the MASS package. The goal is to analyze the correlations between the dependent variable medv (median house value) and the independent variables in the dataset.
```{r}
library(MASS)
library(ryx)
```

This command runs the correlation analysis on the Boston dataset, with medv as the dependent variable.
```{r}
# Perform correlation analysis
result <- ryx(Boston, y = "medv")
```

```{r}
# Print the result
print(result)
```
The print() function displays the correlation results in a table format, showing the correlation coefficient (r), p-value, and significance level for each independent variable.

```{r}
# Visualize the correlation results
plot(result)
```
The plot() function generates a ggplot-based visualization of the correlation results, displaying correlation strength and direction for each independent variable.

```{r}
# Summarize the correlation analysis
summary(result)
```
The summary(result) provides a summary of the correlation analysis, including the median absolute correlation, the range of correlations, and the number of significant correlations.
